A responsive, accessible, and theme-toggle-enabled rating component where users can select a score from 1‚Äì5 and submit their feedback.

Created as part of the building challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## üîç Overview

This project replicates a professional "rate your experience" card that adapts seamlessly between mobile and desktop layouts. The interface includes both light and dark mode themes, ensures smooth animations, and follows accessibility guidelines.

The component features custom focus states for keyboard navigation, hover interactions, and reduced-motion support for users who prefer minimal animation. Once a rating is submitted, a thank-you state is dynamically rendered with the selected score.

## üß† What I Learned

- Building accessible interactive components with semantic HTML
- Creating a functional keyboard navigation logic with `.focus()` and `.click()` methods
- Gained more experience in writing modular JavaScript for cleaner code organization
- Balancing UI feedback between clarity and non-intrusiveness wherein I used `alert()` in my previous code which is not good for UX
- I tried implementing more of the `animation` CSS property and using animation resets in JavaScript using `void element.offsetWidth`
- Complementing CSS animations with `addEventListener("animationend")` and `setTimeout()` for smooth transitions
- Guarding my site from spam clicks by disabling buttons and elements with `button.disabled = true` and `element.style.pointerEvents = "none"` and re-enabling them when an animation ends
